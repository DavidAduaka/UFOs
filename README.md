# UFO_Sightings_Javascript by David Aduaka 

## Overview of UFO Challenge 
Dana, a data journalist, is creating a webpage depicting UFO sighting information as a table and creating filters. As part of the module, we created a filter by date. For the Challenge, we want to allow users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time, such as city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
In the Challenge, we accomplished this by adding four more list elements to the form in the html. This is how the filter looks now.

The table below shows that you can filter individually by each of the new list elements, while leaving the others blank.

This webpage also allows you to filter by several elements. The table below shows the sequence of results for the following query; UFO Sightings in El Cajon, CA with a triangle shape.

## Summary 
In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development. One particular drawback of this design is that it is sequential. One must give serious thought to the order in which one filters the table. Otherwise they may miss out on desired data.

Here are three recommendations that Dana can make to the page in future iterations.

- Under the filter elements, there can be a "Download Excel/CSV" button, which downloads the filtered data for the users.
- Dana can clean the duration data and create another filter element for it. Currently in the table, the duration has various formats that should be standardized.
- Finally, Dana can modify the Filter Date into a Filter Date Range. Users can then search sightings within a designated timeframe.
